            Deeper into the semester and some of my favorite moments of the semester came 
            to fruition. Obviously it was fun to have so many of my home friends come down 
            for the weekend, but what made it even more fun was how well you got along 
            with all of them and how well you matched the vibe on each occasion. There 
            haven’t been a ton of (if any) goon girlfriends who can so quickly mesh with 
            everyone, be funny in their own right, and make everyone else feel good, but 
            that’s exactly what you did. As you know, it’s no fun when your partner is a 
            downer around your friends and I feel so lucky that its not that way with you. 
            Halloween was also a blast with you, by far my favorite one yet. Like I said 
            to you that weekend, I hadn’t ever gone out all three nights of Halloweekend 
            and it was so fun doing so, even when you lacated me by going to Dog Haus. 
            You’re constantly thinking about me and doing everything you can to make he 
            happy.
