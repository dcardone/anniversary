            As the weather got a little nicer, we kept piling on the memories. I know I 
            said February was one of my favorites but April was too. From going to dated 
            with you for the first time, partying with all of the roommates, and you 
            watching my track meets, we only got closer and closer. It was in this month, 
            though, that you met my parents for the first time too! I can’t express how 
            lovely it was for them to sit with you at the track meet and get to know you 
            at an event that meant so much to me. Not to mention how fun dinner was after 
            the meet. It’s still one of my favorite days of college ever and my parents 
            were thrilled to meet you. That part should be obvious given that my mom told 
            you she loved you at the end of the night.
