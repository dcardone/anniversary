        <h3>
            Your kindess, ability to nurture, and uplift was obvious to me from when we 
            first started talking, but you proved it time and time again in March. In some 
            of my worst moments, you never failed to care for me, reassure me, and be the 
            ultimate safehaven. You helped me when I was jealous, you helped me when I was 
            vomiting and literally shitting myself, and I never once felt judged or like I
             was too much. You make every lowpoint feel so much higher and every struggle 
             surrmountable. My parents said they loved you before ever meeting you, not 
             because I loved you, but because of how you treat me. Everything you do for 
             me is so full love and care, which they and everyone else sees.
