            Summer is officially here! My only wish wouldâ€™ve been to spend more of it with 
            you but I think part of what made June special to me is that it showed that we 
            would be able to still have a strong relationship regardless of whether or not 
            we were physically together. I knew that before but this really solidified it. 
            The highs of June were truly incredible. I struggle to recall a more perfect 
            day than sitting on the Chesapeake Bay, enjoying the water, smoking a j, and 
            being in a state of ultimate bliss with you. Follow that with dinner and ice 
            cream in annapolis overlooking the harbor and it made for one of the best days 
            of my life (noticing a theme?). The entire time I was back in CP was the 
            epitome of what I want our future to be. You, me, and a spontaneous plan for 
            each day. It felt like being retired with you. I frequently find myself 
            thinking back to those moments on the beach or in Old Ellicot City and 
            fantasizing about the life we can build for ourselves, together.
