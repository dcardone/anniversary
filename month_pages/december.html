        <h3>
            ITS THE LAST MONTH OF THE FIRST YEAR OF OUR RELATIONSHIP!! What a way to end 
            the semester and our first year of dating. Despite how cold it ended up 
            getting, and the stress of finals, we persevered and still had loads of 
            memories and moments. Formals, parties, paper plates, bar crawls, t breaks, 
            dinner in D.C., there was a little bit of everything. More importantly, there 
            was a ton of you and a ton of us. As I try to reflect back on the year of our 
            relationship, I can’t help but notice that December was a microcosm of the 
            rest of the year. We faced challenges, made some of our best meals, went out a 
            ton, had fancy dinners, locked in for school, and most importantly stuck by 
            each other’s side. Just as I plan to do with you for the rest of my life. I 
            love you, Chloe. Happy first anniversary, my love. The first chapter of a book 
            I can’t wait to write with you.
