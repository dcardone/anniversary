            <h3>
                Not a bad way to start the new year. Less than a month into dating you I knew how 
                special you were and how much I enjoyed being with and around you. I told my 
                parents on a FaceTime call just how wonderfil it feels being in a relationship with 
                someone who goes to your school. Everything with you felt so mature and adult. 
                I told them how I feel like I can be my true self with you, and I neer have to 
                worry about saying the wrong thing or walk on eggshells. My mom asked me “Is it 
                easy, being with her and talking to her?”
                “So easy”
                From the beginning, everything felt like it fell into place perfectly, and 
                loving you was effortless.
