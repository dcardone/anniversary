            Halfway down, our first vacation together, how exciting!! I know we went to 
            the beach in Maryland, but having you over in Ocean Beach was so fulfilling 
            to me. It was incredible special sharing a place that has brought me some of 
            the happiest times of my life. Experiencing the boardwalk, lazy days in the 
            sun, and fireworks with you brought back the childlike joy that I haven’t felt 
            from the beach in a couple of years now. You made all the difference, just as you 
            always do. My second trip down to CP matched the bliss of the first. More 
            beach trips, more late nights at Pizza Kingdom, the first and best brunch I’ve 
            ever had, and more memories made with you. You made the entirety of summer 
            feel like one long lighthearted, activity-filled date that I never wanted to 
            end.
