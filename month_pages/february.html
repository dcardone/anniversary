        <h3>
            I think February was one of my favorite months with you. That said, it's hard 
            to not feel like each month we spend together is better than the next. Itâ€™s 
            hard to pick my favorite moment between our first fancy date at Bistro Cacao, 
            meeting your family, and starting those Fridays where we hung out before 
            track every week. I think what really stood out to me though was your ability 
            to wash away all my moodiness and uneasiness simply by being in your presence. 
            Before we lifted one day, I was feeling out of my routine, hungry, and 
            generally crabby. After some time with you, though, that all melted away. Your 
            company is like taking the most soothing and refreshing shower. You wash away 
            all negative feelings, and time spent with you makes me forget everything else 
            in the world.
