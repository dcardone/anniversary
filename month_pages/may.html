            Our first semester came to a close and there was no shortage of celebration, 
            even if that meant you had to make your way into Tempo to nurse my hangover 
            for an entire day. The following day, though, I had the pleasure of meeting 
            your grandparents for the first time, which made for a lovely Mother’s Day. 
            You then returned the favor by hanging out with and meeting my brother at Dog 
            Haus! I was incredibly excited to enjoy the couple days after finals in 
            College Park with you, capped off by another dinner with my parents. The only 
            sad part was saying goodbye to you the next day after I moved out. Luckily 
            that didn’t last long with you coming up to New Jersey and meeting Jackson! 
            The trip to the Watchung Reservation with you and our dinner at Roots was the 
            best way to kick off summer that I could think of. I felt so loved knowing 
            that you would drive up so soon after saying goodbye. It meant so much then 
            and still does.
