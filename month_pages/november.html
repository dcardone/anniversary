        <h3>
            We were so outdoorsy in November! I love love love our little walks together, 
            whether that’s through campus or the neighborhood through the woods, all of 
            the moments we spent together outside were so refreshing. Meandering through 
            the neighborhoods, pointing out houses we like, how we want our house to look, 
            and what decorations we want makes me so happy. It fills my heart with more than 
            just joy in that moment. It is totally and completely fulfilled when I’m with 
            you, getting excited about the future. On a less serious note, I don’t think 
            there’s anything on a day-to-day basis that brightens my day (besides just you 
            in general), then going to our spot, lighting up, then walking around CVS or 
            downtown College Park, just giggling and having fun with you. It’s the ultimate 
            relaxation and something I know I can look forward to on a consistent basis.
