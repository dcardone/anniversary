            August felt like a tale of two halves. While we spent the first half apart 
            because of your incredible Europe trip, the second half of the month was a 
            whirlwind of fun and intimacy together. You consistently show up for me in 
            the most monumental moments of my life, and my 21st birthday was no 
            difference. The effort you put in to constantly make me happy is remarkable. 
            Having fun with my friends in the basement, breaking the t break, and 
            meandering through New York City with you made me the happiest I’ve ever been. 
            That alone would’ve been all I could’ve asked for out of a birthday, but you 
            didn’t stop there. Before Le Pavillon, michelin star restaurants were only 
            something I had heard about and watched from the countless Youtube cooking and 
            restaurant videos I used to and still do binge. I thought it would be years 
            before I actually had the chance to dine in one. You unveiled this dream and 
            fantasy that had been building in my mind for years, and executed it to 
            perfection. The fact that you picked a perfect restaurant made the already 
            perfect day the hands down best day of my life. All because of you.
